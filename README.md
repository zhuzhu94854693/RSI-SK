Figure 1 shows the schematic diagram of the proposed RSI-SK change detection framework. The RSI-SK method is composed of the following main parts: the backbone of the U-Net network, the pre-training weights of the VGG-16 network, the land cover type probability generation module, the channel attention module, the spatial attention module, the loss function computation module for the influence of external factors, and the adaptive threshold selection method based on the probability of change.
